## Nextstrain build for Marburg and Ravn viruses

This repository provides a [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) build of the Marburg and Ravn virus data from Genbank,
supplemented with data from [virological.org](https://virological.org) for strains from Ghana and Equatorial Guinea.
The output can be seen on the [SANBI](https://www.sanbi.ac.za) Nextstrain [MARVRAVV page](https://nextstrain.sanbi.ac.za/marvravv).

This build is based on the config in the [Zika tutorial repository](https://github.com/nextstrain/zika-tutorial).
